# Fantasia 2 power board

Fantasia 2 has 20 fans arranged in 4 rows of 5. The design files in this folder are for making a PCB that distributes power to each row of fans. You will need 4 of these PCBs to power a complete Fantasia 2 system.

Each PCB has 5 4-pin molex connectors, one for each fan, and a single 2-pin screw terminal to supply power to the PCB.



## Design files

This board was designed using the [Upverter](https://upverter.com) web service.

The schematic, board layout and bill of materials can be viewed [here](https://upverter.com/Trebuchetindustries/5ce411281a8c0028/Fantasia-2-power-board/). Exports from Upverter are available in a subdirectory.
